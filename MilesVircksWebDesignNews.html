<h1>Raising Cane's Location Coming to Eau Claire</h1>
<p>Caniacs of Western Wisconsin will be delighted to find out that Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, the famed chicken restaraunt chain, is opening a new location in Eau Claire very soon.</p>
<p>Originally from Louisiana, their first location opening in 1996, the fast food chain has quickly spread across the nation, cultivating a devoted following of chicken lovers all over America. Unforutnately for the Chippewa Valley area, the nearest Raising Cane's for years had been the location in Woodbury, Minnesota, quite a long trip away. However, that is soon to change.</p>
<h2>Grand Opening to be Sooner Than Expected</h2>
<p>When the location was announced in August 2023, the opening was planned for 2025, however, a mild winter pushing construction plans forward a few months, the planned opening date is now set for November 2024, says <cite>Volume One</cite>. This announcement has only increased the excitement of those already pumped for the 2025 opening, like Eau Claire resident Robert Jackson, who had the following to say</p>
<blockquote>
    <q>I already had enough trouble trying to contain myself from getting Cane's semi-regularly, even when it was in <i>another</i> state! I may have to have someone keep an eye on me so I don't empty my wallet, ha-ha.</q>

</blockquote>
<p>This new location will be located on the south side of Eau Claire, between Gateway Drive and Prill Road. This is conveniently located in between many other businesses that all share the same area in south Eau Claire, including the <i>Oakwood Mall</i>, which will hopefully drive up sales. However, we must caution people that when this location opens, traffic in the area will become much worse than it already is (Despite this area being the busiest section of the city.) It's advised that people find alternate routes around the south end before November.</p>
<p>If anyone reading is interested in getting involvement on a greater level with Raising Cane's before it's opening, they are still hiring, according to <em>Volume One and Penny Storcz</em>, they have a few positions open still for higher level management and supervision posts.</p>
<p>All in all, the launch of a new fast food place, especially one of Raising Canes' popularity, is sure to be a boon for the area and it's people.</p>
