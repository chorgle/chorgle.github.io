         <p>Albert is the most essential member of The Team. An orange shorthair cat, Albert is beloved amongst our members and is the glue that holds us together. Albert, after a close encounter with a squirrel at the window, became determined to remove squirrels from the entire Tri-State Area, thus he formed The Team. Albert, however, does suffer from attention issues, frequently playing with his toys instead of focusing on our team's goals.</p>

         <p>Richard Nixon is, er...was the 37th President of the United States. We're not quite sure how he even got on our team, but he's our man in the back, with plenty of fixers and plumbers of his own, he helps us greatly in our mission to stop squirrels. Just uh, don't ask him about his presidency. He doesn't like that.</p>

         <p>Flapjack is a good boy. Flapjack is a Golden Retriever/Mutt mix, and he's renowned for his good behavior. He is always sniffing and looking out of HQ's windows, looking for possible threats. He's also our recon on missions. Though Albert starts fights with him sometimes and he can get a bit wild about the squirrels, Flapjack is a valued member of The Team.</p>

         <p>The Smilies are uh...honestly, we're not really sure. All we know is that they are sentient smiley face bouncy balls. They've always got a positive attitude, and are the morale boosters in the group. However, they don't have any physical prowess, given that they are bouncy balls. But still, the help they bring to the team cannot be understated.</p>
