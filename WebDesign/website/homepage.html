     <p>Welcome to the Campaign Corner! Your one stop shop for all things American politics. Here we have election results past and present, with a focus on the stories of historical elections and campaigns throughout US history. This site was created by Miles Vircks (the person typing this). I've always had a love of history and have recently found a passion in US Political History, and want to share my passion with the world! Click on the links above to explore the site. If you wish to contact me, my personal email is moymoyprower@gmail.com. Have fun!</p>
