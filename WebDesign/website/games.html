         <p>Ever wanted to see if you could win an election? If so, then The New Campaign Trail is the game for you! The Campaign Trail is a game where you play as candidates throughout history, answering questions about your campaign or policy while trying to appeal to the nation. The site offers 15 base game scenarios, simulation historical presidential elections. On top of this, NCT features a bubbling modding scene, where people have created custom scenarios of all shapes and sizes. I would very highly recommend this website if you're anything like me, intersted in our political process and the history of it. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/457588/living-alt-history-election-dreams-and-nightmares-in-the-campaign-trail" target="_blank">This website is also covered more in a polygon article</a>.</p>

         <p>If you're ever curious about how the math of elections work out, then you should try out YAPMS (Yet Another Political Map Simulator). Simply click on the party you want to win the state, and it will be filled in, and the state's amount added to the electoral (or whatever else) count. This website is incredibly useful for creating hypothetical scenarios, or mapping out alternate histories. I do prefer the old website's UI however, and that knocks it down from 5 stars.</p>

         <p>The only of these games/tools that are on a gaming platform, The Political Process is an incredibly in-depth political simulation game. You create a politician, choose your location, and run for office. This game has a lot of features; one minute you'll be campaigning and running targeted ads, the next you'll be trying to balance a budget, and the next you'll be trying to pass a bill through congress. The possibilities are really endless with this game. However, I wouldn't recommend this game to casuals, as this game goes very in-depth and you may find yourself confused or frustrated with just how much you have to do in it.</p>

         <p>Our Campaigns is a giant database of all elections, mostly American but also many abroad. For the election buff, this is a paradise of information, almost like a wikipedia for elections. For most races, you'll be able to find the exact county margins, as well the ads, polls, and endorsements of the campaign. However, this website is a maze to actually get to where you want, and it doesn't really help with navigation. On top of this, it's poorly optimized and loads slowly, so only go in if you know what you're doing.</p>
